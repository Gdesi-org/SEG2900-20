Project Name: Gdesi

Project Description: Gdesi is a website used to compare prices of products with various parameters. The goal of Gdesi is to be able
to provide the user with a list of all the different places any product can be found online, from cars to laptops and more. With the
added convenience of being able to compare in-store and online prices as well as by location, it makes online shopping incredibly easy.

Since our startup is a search engine, our product page is an example of a search on gdesi
