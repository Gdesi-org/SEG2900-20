Project Name: Gdesi

Project Description: Gdesi is a website used to compare prices of products with various parameters. The goal of Gdesi is to be able
to provide the user with a list of all the different places any product can be found online, from cars to laptops and more. With the
added convenience of being able to compare in-store and online prices as well as by location, it makes online shopping incredibly easy.

Since our startup is a search engine, our product page is an example of a search on gdesi

All the web pages are in the website 2.0 folder. The hand written css files are in the css folder with the same name as their html counterpart. The rest of the css files are not hand written. All the files in the js and scss folders are not hand written. All the javascript written by us is inline (in the html files). The pricing page was combined with the home page. As stated above, our product page is an example of a search on gdesi. To see it, please click the Show me around! button on the home page and follow the instructions that will follow. The product_search(black_cars) page was used for the demo in our pitch, and is not meant to be part of our website.
