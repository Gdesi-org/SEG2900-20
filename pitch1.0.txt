How gdesi makes a profit:
- Ads
- Sponsored item slots at the top of the list when a user searches for an item
- Subscription based service (1$ a month) that gives the user access to the refine search feature (more on that later) and acccess to an email service that sends the user a notification when an item falls under a certain price
